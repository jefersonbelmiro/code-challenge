## Code Challenge for Front End Developer (Angular)
Code Challenge
Task Description
```
Create a simple Angular application that displays a list of users fetched from a public REST API. The application should be responsive and include the following features:

- Fetch user data from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Display the user names and email addresses in a responsive card layout.
- Implement a search functionality that allows users to filter the displayed users by name.
- Ensure that the application follows best practices for Angular development, 
    including the use of components, services, and reactive programming.

Requirements

- Use Angular (preferably Angular 11 or higher).
- Implement responsive design using CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap).
- Use RxJS for handling asynchronous data fetching.
- Write clean, maintainable code adhering to SOLID principles.

```

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
